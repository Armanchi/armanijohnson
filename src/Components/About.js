            My name is Armani Johnson. Currently I am studying Computer Science
            at Houston Community College. <br />
            I am interested in any type of web development where I can 
            use problem solving creatively.<br />

            In my free time I enjoy reading, watching art history video essays on YouTube, and <br />
            attending cconcerts and conventions with my family.
